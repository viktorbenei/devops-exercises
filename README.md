# devops-exercises

DevOps Exercises.

## Important notes

These are examples/exercises **not production ready setups** in most cases! Good for getting started when you need some help/pointers while you're learning any of the tools but don't just copy-paste e.g. a Terraform config and expect it to be production ready!

That said I try to update these when I can, but **I don't aim for keeping these up-to-date all the time**. These are examples used in own exercises/explorations, and short demonstrations how certain things can be done.

## The list

- `kubernetes-setup/gke/terraform`: Create a GKE Kubernetes Cluster with Terraform.
